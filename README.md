# Diversity in STEM Data Analysis - Berea College

This repository contains our team's work on analyzing diversity in STEM at Berea College. We are a group of 6 TAs working on this project as part of the Diversity in STEM committee.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BC-CS-Website-Team/DiversityInStem.git
   cd diversity-stem-analysis
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your task:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a pull request on GitHub for review.

5. After review and approval, your changes will be merged into the main branch.
